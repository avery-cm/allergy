		<div class = "bio">She’s an international sweetheart, but she can also be found in savory places!
She is known be in cakes, ice cream, and your favorite brunch foods. She is not in bread and pizza, contrary to popular belief. <br>Severity level: 10.</br></div>
		<div class = "bio">Known for his time in The Crusty Crustaceans and the world regarded group, SuSHi. The second discovered Allergy came on so strong that Avery had to take Benadryl, starting a lifelong dependence on the drug. <br>Severity level: 10.</br></div>
		<div class = "bio">Avery is nuts about peanuts...but not cashews, almonds, pecans, walnuts, pistachios, or hazelnuts (that means Nutella). <br>Severity level: 8.</br></div>
		<div class = "bio">Sometimes not sure if how he got to be an Allergy, but there’s no need for insecurity--he’s caused many a puffy lip and closed throat! Best when cooked for a heck of a long time. <br>Severity level: 5.</br></div>
		<div class = "bio">She’s fruity, she’s fresh, she’s the first half of the B’nana and Kiwi duo. Considered by some to be more of an Intolerance than an Allergy. <br>Severity level: 2.</br> </div>
		<div class = "bio">Sometimes appears with the Allergies alongside her Chinese cousin, Dragonfruit. <br>Severity level: 3.</br></div>
		<div class = "bio">The only human in the group. Has way too many Allergies and thought she'd have some fun with them for once.<br>Severity Level: Off the Charts.</br></div>
